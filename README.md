**Daniel's and Oscar's Master's Thesis tool**

This tool is created for the purpose to serve as proof of concept in our master's thesis. This tool is supposed
to be used in the planning phase in software development to help product owners to make better decisions.

This tool answers the following important questions:  
*Which files will this story impact?
*What is the technical debt in the impacted files?

This tool is use to perform Continuous Refactorization :-)
